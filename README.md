Scrapping for a job

Technologies you will need to run this code: 
- Node.js
- NPM
- Mysql

Tu run the program: 
- run 'npm i' at the root of repository
- make sure mysql is running and change your mysql credentials in the app.js
- run 'node app.js' again at the root of repository
- connect on any web browser at 'http://localhost:8080/' (I've tested this on Google Chrome)

Have fun downloading random data :)
